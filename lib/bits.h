/******************************************************************************
 * Bitstring macros 
 * ````````````````
 * Macros for working with "bitstrings", that is, arrays of bytes where
 * the functional unit of logic is the individual bits. Useful for things
 * like radix trees, Bloom filters, bitboards for computer chess, or any
 * other succinct data structure or process.
 *
 * AUTHORS
 * Jason Linehan, with lots of help
 *
 * HISTORY
 * These macros were the product of a lot of experimentation and study.
 * Although there are few innovative approaches to these macros or their
 * equivalents, I consider these to be "my implementation" in that they
 * incorporate features, naming conventions, and styles from many
 * different sets of macros. Numerous things have also been altered,
 * expanded upon, or eliminated, so that they reflect my particular ideas
 * of form and function. 
 *
 * The famous header file xtrapbits.h, Copyright 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 
 * 1994 by Digital Equipment Corporation, was a good starting point.
 * It was used by the X11 developers to define platform-independent bit
 * array manipulation.
 *
 * Notable contributors included:
 *
 *      Dick Annicchiarico
 *      Robert Chesler
 *      Dan Coutu
 *      Gene Durso
 *      Marc Evans
 *      Alan Jamison
 *      Mark Henry
 *      Ken Miller
 *
 * Also, numerous examples floating around comp.lang.c, and many other
 * places, I'm sure.

 *
 * The subexpression (v - 0x01010101UL), evaluates to a high bit set in any

 * The sub-expression ~v & 0x80808080UL evaluates to high bits set in bytes 
 * where the byte of v doesn't have its high bit set (so the byte was less 
 * than 0x80). Finally, by ANDing these two sub-expressions the result is 
 * the high bits set where the bytes in v were zero, since the high bits 
 * set due to a value greater than 0x80 in the first sub-expression are 
 * masked off by the second.

 * ones32
 * ``````
 * Compute the number of set bits (ones) in a 32-bit integer w
 * @w: unsigned 32-bit integer value
 * Returns: unsigned integer representing the number of '1' bits in w.
 *
 * NOTES
 * The population count of a binary integer value x is the number of one 
 * bits in the value. Although many machines have single instructions for 
 * this, the single instructions are usually microcoded loops that test a 
 * bit per cycle; a log-time algorithm coded in C is often faster. The 
 * following code uses a variable-precision SWAR algorithm to perform a 
 * tree reduction adding the bits in a 32-bit value:
 *
 * It is worthwhile noting that this SWAR population count algorithm can 
 * be improved upon for the case of counting the population of multi-word 
 * bit sets. How? The last few steps in the reduction are using only a 
 * portion of the SWAR width to produce their results; thus, it would be 
 * possible to combine these steps across multiple words being reduced.
 *
 * CAVEAT
 * The AMD Athlon optimization guidelines suggest a very similar algorithm 
 * that replaces the last three lines with return((x * 0x01010101) >> 24);. 
 * For the Athlon (which has a very fast integer multiply), I would have 
 * expected AMD's code to be faster... but it is actually 6% slower according 
 * to my benchmarks using a 1.2GHz Athlon (a Thunderbird). Why? Well, it so 
 * happens that GCC doesn't use a multiply instruction - it writes out the 
 * equivalent shift and add sequence!
